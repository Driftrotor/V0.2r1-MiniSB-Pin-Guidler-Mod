This MOD adds a simple PIN to the Guidler pivot point to STOP that wear from happening!

All you need are these THREE printed parts and a 3mm PIN 25-27mm long and your set!

The pin provides a stable and precise pivot to give a super stable guidler for your extrusion gears in the MiniSB, ensuring a more consistent and longer lasting Toolhead for your V0!


NOTE, The PIN holes will require you to gently run a 3mm drill bit through them to give the perfect FIT for the PIN.
this is purposefully done so that everyone gets that perfect FIT
